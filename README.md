# YouTube-Project

This project was completed for my capstone classe for my bachelors degree. The dataset is from kaggle.com and contains a list of top trending videos on YouTube. The data contains information on the videos from different areas. Included in the data is the amount of comments, likes, dislikes, and views each video received.
